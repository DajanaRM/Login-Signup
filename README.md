# Login and Signup forms

Simply styled HTML login, signup and forgotten password forms, appearing after specific user's action

Login form is visible by default. 
When user chooses 'Forgot password?', form to enter an email address,to which reset code/link should be sent, appears (mailer not included).
After button 'Sign up' is clicked (under 'Already have an account?'), registration form becomes visible (replacing Login form).
Registration form has an option to return to Login form ('Already have an account?' --> 'Sign in').
There is PHP and AJAX validation of all forms.
Google reCaptcha is integrated, but needs to be uncommented.
